# Config Note
For security of my personal discord and the bot itself, I have exclude a keys.json file which would be in this folder.  If you are pulling this repo to create your own version of the bot, you need to create a key.json with the following proproties:
* client_id
* client_secret
    * _You can find both of these inside of the discord developer portal if you click on your app under the general information tab._
* token
    * _You can find this under the bot tab of your app._
